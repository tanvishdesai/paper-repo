Questions may ask to differentiate between routing protocols (e.g., RIP vs. OSPF), identify the function of a specific header field (e.g., TTL), determine the capabilities of a device at a certain OSI layer (e.g., a Layer-4 firewall), or classify protocols based on their characteristics (e.g., stateful vs. stateless). This type tests foundational knowledge of the networking stack and its components.",
