      "explanation": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>TTL(Time to Live) - It is a mechanism that limits the lifespan of a packet in a computer network. It is implemented with the help of a counter or timestamp which is set by the sender of the packet and embedded in the packet itself. It represents the maximum lifetime of a packet in the network. When a packet routes through a network, each router checks the current value of its TTL, if the TTL value is not zero then only the router accepts the packet, and decrements its value by 1. This process takes place at every router. If some router founds the TTL value of the incoming packet to be 0, then it simply discards/destroys the packet ( because the lifetime of the packet is over, and hence the packet is not eligible to be in the network ).  One of the main purposes of setting the TTL value and doing all this process is to ensure that there is no undelivered packet in the network which is circulating indefinitely, and to avoid the problem of duplicate delivery of the same packet, which may arise in the case of network congestion.  Now, routing decisions are taken place at the network layer. hence we have to see in the above question that when the packet is going through the network layer.  LANs work at Data Link Layer only, hence the packet doesn't reach network layer in LANs.  So in the question above, Except LANs, at all other points routing decisions have to be taken. Hence TTL value will be checked and manipulated at those points/routers.  At Receiver end also, the packet has to go through the network layer so as to reach to application layer, hence Receiver will also check and decrement the TTL value.  So there are 6 routers in the above diagram. Initially TTL value was 32, so at the Receiver it will become 32 - 6 = 26.  </span></p><img alt=\"TTL (1)\" height=\"360\" loading=\"auto\" src=\"https://rkokdq5fgqqf84hb.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/gate-images/2014/q_3066/f335c7afa8adf905-PikSVkTUzHXP9ZSw8fjSm2Bprgw3Hz.jpg\" width=\"480\"/><p><b><strong> </strong></b></p>",

Therefore, option </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong>(A)</strong></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span> and </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong>(D)</strong></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span> are eliminated. So we consider a shorter product n*(n-1). n*(n-1) is always an even number. So the subexpression \" n * (n-1) / 2 \" in option B would always produce an integer, which means no precision loss in this subexpression. And when we consider \" n*(n-1)/2*(n-2) \", it will always give a number which is a multiple of 3. So dividing it with 3 won't have any loss.</span></p>",

[ ( 3-z, 1, 1) (0, -z, 0) (0, 0, -z ) ] 4) Solve the matrix by expanding 1st column. result is : (1-z)(1-z)(z)(z) - (3-z)(z)(z) = 0 solve further to get : z^3 ( 3-z ) ( z-2 ) = 0 hence z = 0 , 0 , 0 , 3 , 2 Therefore product of non zero eigenvalues is 6.</span></p>",

The idea is to use Spatial Locality (Once a location is retrieved, it is highly probable that the nearby locations would be retrieved in near future).   </span><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>TAG bits : Each cache block is given a set of TAG bits to identify which main memory block is present in that cache block. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span> Option A : If the block size is small, there would be less number of near-by address for future references by CPU to be present into that block. Hence this is not better spatial locality. </span><br><span> Option B : If the block size is smaller, no of blocks would be more in cache, hence more cache tag bits would be needed, not less. </span><br><span> Option C : Cache tag bits are more ( because more no of blocks due to smaller block size ), but more cache tag bits can't lower the hit time ( even it will increase ).  </span><br><span>Option D : If there is a miss at cache memory ( i.e. the needed block by the CPU is not present in the cache memory ), then that block has to be moved from next lower level of memory ( lets say main memory ) in the memory hierarchy, and if the block size is lower, then it takes less time to be placed into cache memory, hence less miss penalty. </span><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span> Hence option D is correct.</span></p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lz3J33WzNOo?start=2871\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>",

So, width of set index decoder can surely decrease - (B) is false. Width of way-selection multiplexer must be increased as we have to double the ways to choose from- (C) is false As the number of sets gets decreased, the number of possible cache block entries that a set maps to gets increased.

Principle of Duality: Any theorem or identity in Boolean algebra remains true if 0 and 1 are swapped and . and + are swapped throughout.  There are two properties for self-dual functions: 1. It is neutral (no of minterms = no of maxterms) 2. A single function does not contains two mutually exclusive terms.  Considering the above properties. If we have n-variable then we have 2^n minterms/maxterms From 2^n minterms/maxterms there are (2^n)/2 mutually exclusive pairs. ie 2^(n-1)  So we have 2^(n-1) pairs to use to make self-dual functions. So, by Fundamental principle of counting, because each pair in 2^(n-1) has two choices.  No of self-dual functions from n-variables are = 2*2*2...2^(n-1) times  = 2^(2^(n-1))  or example if n=3 We have minterms as(000,001,010,...,111) Mutually exclusive pairs are (0,7),(1,6),(2,5),(3,4) The pairs are mutually exclusive since they cannot come in a self-dual function together.  So here we have.2*2*2*2 functions ie 16.</span></p>",

In each iteration of the loop, a process performs a single computation that requires tc CPU milliseconds and then initiates a single I/O operation that lasts for tio milliseconds.

Also, the scheduling overhead of the OS is negligible.
