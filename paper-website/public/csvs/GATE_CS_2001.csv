1,Which of the following does not interrupt a running process?,,A device,,Timer,,Scheduler process,,Power failure,,C,MCQ,"Scheduler process doesn’t interrupt any process, it’s Job is to select the processes for following three purposes. Long-term scheduler (or job scheduler) –selects which processes should be brought into the ready queue Short-term scheduler (or CPU scheduler) –selects which process should be executed next and allocates CPU. Mid-term Scheduler (Swapper)- present in all systems with virtual memory, temporarily removes processes from main memory and places them on secondary memory (such as a disk drive) or vice versa. The mid-term scheduler may decide to swap out a process which has not been active for some time, or a process which has a low priority, or a process which is page faulting frequently, or a process which is taking up a large amount of memory in order to free up main memory for other processes, swapping the process back in later when more memory is available, or when the process has been unblocked and is no longer waiting for a resource.",,Operating System,Core Concepts,Processes and Threads

Suppose the instance in the given relation is the following: x y ----- 5 6 4 5 3 4 6 6 Now if we delete tuple (5,6) then tuple ( 4,5 ) should also be deleted ( as 5 in the tuple (4, 5) was referencing to 5 in the tuple(5,6) which no longer exist, hence the referencing tuple should also be deleted), and as (4,5) got deleted hence tuple (3,4) should also be deleted for the same reason.

So if for a given language, we can come up with an finite automaton, we can say that the language is regular. But sometimes, it is not quite obvious to design an automaton corresponding to a given language but it surely exists. In that case, we should not start thinking that the given language is not regular. We should use pumping lemma to decide whether the given language is regular or not. According to pumping lemma, “Suppose L is a regular language, then there exists a l ≥ 1 such that for all string s ∈ L, where |s| ≥ l, we can always split s (there exists at least one such splitting) in such a way that s can be written as xyz with |xy| ≤ l and y ≠ ε  and for all i ≥ 0 , xy i z ∈ L”. l is known as pumping length. Let’s rephrase the given Lemma for non regular languages. Suppose L is a language, if for all l ≥ 1 there exist a string s ∈ L with |s| ≥ l such that for all splitting (there doesn’t exists a single splitting which doesn’t follow this rule) of s in form of xyz such that |xy| ≥ l and y ≠ ε , there exists an i≥ 0 such that xy i z ∉ L, then L is not regular. Notice that here we stress on finding such s if we want to prove that a language is not regular. Choice of the Questions: (a) In choice 1 , Lets first consider w being of length n and containing only a. In this case the language represents a n a n . The length of the string represented by language should be Even. Consider l = n, then xyz = a n a n with xy = a n . lets assume y = a, then consider the membership of xy i z with i = 0. This will simply be of odd length which doesn’t belongs to L. So L is not regular. To discuss it in more detail, let’s consider another example. Suppose w = a p b, then string formed by L will be a p ba p b which is of length 2p + 2. Assume l = p, then xy = a p . suppose y = a, then consider the membership of xy i z with i = 0. This certainly doesn’t belongs to L. So L is not regular. (b) In choice 2 , The first example will work as above. In the second example, the string will be a p bba p , and there will be no changes in process for proving it to be non regular. (c) In choice 3 , Assuming that we are considering integer from 0 and 0 2∗n results in empty string, Which is also accepted, We can simply construct a DFA as given below. It simply accepts a string if it is either empty or contain even number of zeros. So the language is regular. (d) In choice 4 , We can simply assume that the pumping length l =i 2 /2. Now consider the xy = 0 l with y = 0, Now if we check the membership of xy 2 z, we can find that this will represent 0 i^2 +1, and corresponding to which there exists no j such that j 2 = i 2 + 1 where i and j are integer except j = 1 and i = 0. But since i can’t be zero. In Short, using pumping lemma, we can generate 0 i^2 +1 as well as 0 i^2 -1, which won’t be available in L.

39,A processor needs software interrupt to,,test the interrupt system of the processor,,implement co-routines,,obtain system services which need execution of privileged instructions,,return from subroutine,,C,MCQ,"Software interrupts are required by CPU to obtain System services which need execution of privileged instructions. A software interrupt is caused either by an exceptional condition in the processor itself, or a special instruction in the instruction set which causes an interrupt when it is executed. The former is often called a trap or exception and is used for errors or events occurring during program execution that are exceptional enough that they cannot be handled within the program itself.. An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is executing. The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and executing a function called an interrupt handler (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event. This interruption is temporary, and, after the interrupt handler finishes, the processor resumes normal activities. So (C) is correct option",,Operating System,Core Concepts,System calls

A grammar is ambiguous if there exists a string s such that the grammar has more than one leftmost derivations for s. We could also come up with more than one rightmost derivations for a string to prove the above proposition, but not both of right and leftmost. An unambiguous grammar can have different rightmost and leftmost derivations. 2. LL parser is top-down by nature. Leftmost derivation is, intuitively, expanding or top-down in fashion, hence such convention. Rightmost derivation, on the other hand, seems like a compressing or bottom-up thing. 3. LALR is more powerful than SLR, even when both have the same LR(0) states, due to the fact that SLR checks for lookaheads by looking at FIRST and FOLLOW from the grammar after constructing its parse table and on the other hand, LALR computes lookaheads from the LR(0) states while constructing the parse table, which is a better method. 4.
