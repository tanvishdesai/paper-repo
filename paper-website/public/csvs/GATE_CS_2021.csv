That is undefined behavior. Though it also should be an syntax error as it does not satisfies syntax of ANSI C program for ""Integer"". Lexical analyzer : The lexical analyzer typically would not flag this as an error it just generates tokens for further analysis. Syntax analyzer : The syntax analyzer checks the syntax of the program based on grammar rules. Since Integer is not a valid type in C, the syntax analyzer would not generate a valid parse tree, but it doesn’t typically flag the error at this point either. Semantic analyzer : The semantic analyzer checks the meaning of the program, including type checking and variable declarations. Since Integer is not a valid type, the semantic analyzer will detect the type mismatch or undeclared type, and this phase will throw the error. Machine dependent optimizer : By this point, all type errors have already been caught, so it will not throw an error related to Integer . Answer: The Semantic analyzer phase will throw the error because it checks for type correctness, and Integer is not a valid type in C.
