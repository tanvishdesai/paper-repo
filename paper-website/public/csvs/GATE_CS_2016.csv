Which one of the following is TRUE?,,This is a correct two-process synchronization solution.,,This solution violates mutual exclusion requirement.,,This solution violates progress requirement.,,This solution violates bounded wait requirement.,,C,MCQ,"A mutual exclusive requirement prevents simultaneous access to a shared resource. Since, semaphore turn is initialized to zero and this semaphore value is changing only after critical section for given processes. So, this ensures at most one process in the critical section at a time, i.e., mutual exclusive requirement is satisfied. Progress means that process should eventually be able to complete. But directly Process 1 can not go critical section as semaphore value is 0 initially and this process 1 can go CS only after process 0. So, progress requirement is not satisfied. Bounded waiting means no process should wait for a resource for infinite amount of time. Process 1 can go directly and Process 1 can go after process 0 into critical section. So, Bounded waiting is satisfied. Option (C) is correct.",,Operating System,Concurrency,Critical section problem

3,"In an Ethernet local area network, which one of the following statements is TRUE ?",,A station stops to sense the channel once it starts transmitting a frame.,,The purpose of the jamming signal is to pad the frames that are smaller than the minimum frame size.,,A station continues to transmit the packet even after the collision is detected.,,The  exponential  backoff  mechanism  reduces  the  probability  of  collision  on retransmissions,,D,MCQ,"An Ethernet is the most popularly and widely used LAN network for data transmission. It is a protocol of data link layer and it tells how the data can be formatted to transmit and how to place the data on network for transmission. Now considering the Ethernet protocol we will discuss all the options one by one (A) This option is false as in Ethernet the station is not required to stop to sense for the channel prior frame transmission. (B) A signal is jammed to inform all the other devices or stations about collision that has occurred so that further data transmission is stopped. Thus this option is also false (C) Once the collision has occurred the data transmission is stopped as the jam signal is sent. Thus this option is also incorrect. (D) To reduce the probability of collision on retransmissions an exponential back off mechanism is used. Thus, only this option is true.",,Computer Networks,Data Link Layer,MAC protocols
4,Consider a 128×10 3 bits/second satellite communication link with one-way propagation delay of 150 milliseconds. Selective retransmission (repeat) protocol is used on this link to send data with a frame size of 1 kilobyte. Neglect the transmission time of acknowledgment. The minimum number of bits required for the sequence number field to achieve 100% utilization is ___________,,2,,4,,6,,8,,B,MCQ,"To achieve 100% efficiency, the number of frames that we should send = 1 + 2 * Tp / Tt where, Tp is propagation delay, and Tt is transmission delay. So Number of frames sent = 1 + 4.687 = 5.687 (approx 6) As the protocol used is Selective repeat, Receiver window size should be equal to Sender window size. Then Number of distinct sequence numbers required = 6 + 6 = 12 Number of bits required to represent 12 distinct numbers = 4 So, Answer is (B)",,Computer Networks,Data Link Layer,Flow and error control

Note : This question was asked as Numerical Answer Type.,,200,,250,,400,,1200,,A,MCQ,"For frame size to be minimum, its transmission time should be equal to twice of one way propagation delay. i.e, Tx = 2Tp suppose minimum frame size is L bits. Tx = L / B where B is the bandwidth  = 20 * 10 6 bits/sec and given Tp = 40 micro seconds as Tx = 2 Tp L / B = 80 micro seconds L = B * 80 micro seconds = 20 * 10 6 bits/sec * 80 micro seconds = 1600 bits Now as the answer has to be given in Bytes, hence, 1600 / 8 bytes = 200 bytes.

Option 1: Quicksort runs in Θ (n 2 ) time In quick sort worst case if the first or last element is selected at the pivot element. For a Quicksort, in the worst-case recurrence, the relation will become T(n) = T(n-1) + T (1) + n, Which gives T(n) = Θ (n 2 ) So, it is correct. Option 2: Bubble sort runs in Θ (n 2 ) time If an array is already sorted in ascending order, then at that time there will be no swap after the completion of the inner for loop of bubble sort. In this way, bubble sort will take Θ (n) time complexity. Option 3: Merge sort runs in Θ (n) time Merge sort uses the divide and conquer policy to sort the elements. As elements are already sorted in ascending order. Recurrence relation for merge sort: T(n) = 2 T (n/2) + n, This will give Θ (n*log(n)) time complexity. Option 4: Insertion sort runs in Θ (n) time When a new element that is greater than all the elements of the array is added, then there will be no swap but only a single comparison. In n -1 swaps, only 0 swaps and n-1 comparisons are there. The total time complexity in this case will be Θ (n). So, it is correct.",,Algorithms,Complexity Analysis,Algorithm analysis

The stages are connected one to the next to form a pipe - instructions enter at one end, progress through the stages, and exit at the other end. Pipelining does not decrease the time for individual instruction execution. Instead, it increases instruction throughput. The throughput of the instruction pipeline is determined by how often an instruction exits the pipeline. The same concept is used in pipelining. Bottleneck here is UF as it takes 5 ns while UG takes 3ns only. We have to do 10 such calculations and we have 2 instances of UF and UG respectively. Since there are two functional units, each unit get 5 numbers of units to compute on. Suppose computation starts at time 0. which means G starts at 0 and F starts at 3rd second since G finishes computing first element at third second. So UF can be done in 5*10/2=25 nano seconds. For the start UF needs to wait for UG output for 3 ns and rest all are pipelined and hence no more wait. So answer is 3+25=28 Another solution : Since there are two functional units each unit get 5 numbers of units to compute on. Suppose computation starts at time 0. which means G starts at 0 and F starts at 3rd second since G finishes computing first element at third second.

The client’s computer will make a DNS query to one of its internet service provider’s DNS server. Step 2 : As soon as DNS server is located a TCP connection is to be established for the further communication. The TCP protocol requests the server to establishing a connection by sending a TCP SYN message.  Which is further responded by the server using SYN_ ACK from server to client and then ACK back to server from client (3- way hand shaking protocol).

So if the above expression is a tautology then we can say that X is logically implied by P ∧ (P ⇒ Q). So we need to find X for which [ P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) ] ⇒ X will be always true for all values of P, Q and X. Look at the below table: P....Q...(P ⇒ Q)...[P ∧ (P ⇒ Q)].......X.......[ P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) ] ⇒ X 0....0.....1............0.............1/0............1...... 0....1.....1............0.............1/0....  ......1...... 1....0.....0..... ......0.............1/0............1...... 1....1.....1............1..............1.............1....... Notice that value of X doesn't matter if premise of expression i.e Premise of [ P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) ] ⇒ X i.e [ P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) ] is 0 meaning the final expression would be a tautology for all values of X if [ P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) ] is 0  but if premise is 1 (as in last row) then X must be 1 so that the final implication i.e., [ P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) ] ⇒ X is true for all values. If you replace X by all 5 options then you will find that for X = Q, True, P ∨ Q, ¬Q ∨ P the said expression would always be true for X = False the expression would not be a tautology. Hence the number of expression is 4.

A CFG consists of the following components: A set of terminal symbols, which are the characters of the alphabet that appear in the strings generated by the grammar. A set of nonterminal symbols, which are placeholders for patterns of terminal symbols that can be generated by the nonterminal symbols. A set of productions, which are rules for replacing (or rewriting) nonterminal symbols (on the left side of the production) in a string with other nonterminal or terminal symbols (on the right side of the production). A start symbol, which is a special nonterminal symbol that appears in the initial string generated by the grammar.
