1,"A bit-stuffing based framing protocol uses an 8-bit delimiter pattern of 01111110. If the output bit-string after stuffing is 01111100101, then the input bit-string is",,0111110100,,0111110101,,0111111101,,0111111111,,B,MCQ,"Bit Stuffing is used to create framing . 8-bit delimiter pattern is 01111110. The output bit-string after stuffing is 0111110 0 101. The above highlighted bit is stuffed bit. So input bit-string must be 0111110101. Alternative approach - The given delimiter pattern is 01111110. Delimiters are used to define the beginning and end of data. Since delimiters are special bit-patterns used for special purposes, they must be avoided in the encoded form of the input data. To achieve this, Bit Stuffing is used. On the sending side, any time five consecutive 1's have been transmitted from the body of the message (i.e., excluding when the sender is trying to transmit the distinguished 01111110 delimiter sequence), the sender inserts a 0 before transmitting the next bit.  If the receiver gets five consecutive 1's, it makes its decision based on the next bit it sees (i.e., the bit following the five 1s).  If the next bit is a 0, it must have been stuffed, and so the receiver removes it.  If the next bit is a 1, then one of two things is true: Either this is the end-of-frame marker or an error has been introduced into the bit stream. Going further and reading the next bit distinguishes these two cases. If the next bit is 0, then it is the end of frame marker (delimiter 01111110), and if the next bit is a 1 then there is must be an error in the frame and it is discarded. So, For the data sequence 0111111101 Encoding would be - 011111 0 1101 Here the bold 0 is stuffed to distinguish it from the delimiter sequence. Coming back to the question, the encoded string is - 01111100101 and when the receiver senses that it has received 5 consecutive 1's then  If the next bit is 0, then it is stuffed If the next bit is 1, then next to next bit would tell if the frame has ended or there is an error. In this case, the next bit is 0 which means it was stuffed, so the corresponding input sequence is- 0111110101. Therefore, option (B) is correct.",,Computer Networks,Data Link Layer,Framing
2,You have an array of n elements. Suppose you implement quick sort by always choosing the central element of the array as the pivot.

Whichever element we take as Pivot, either first or middle, worst case will be O(n 2 ) since Pivot is fixed in position.

3,"A system uses 3 page frames for storing process pages in main memory. It uses the Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement policy. Assume that all the page frames are initially empty.

An interrupt that occurs when a program requests data that is not currently in real memory. The interrupt triggers the operating system to fetch the data from a virtual memory and load it into RAM.  Now, 4, 7, 6, 1, 7, 6, 1, 2, 7, 2 is the reference string, you can think of it as data requests made by a program.  Now the system uses 3 page frames for storing process pages in main memory. It uses the Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement policy. [ ] - Initially page frames are empty.i.e. no process pages in main memory. [ 4 ] - Now 4 is brought into 1st frame (1st page fault) Explanation: Process page 4 was requested by the program, but it was not in the main memory(in form of page frames),which resulted in a page fault, after that process page 4 was brought in the main memory by the operating system. [ 4 7 ] - Now 7 is brought into 2nd frame (2nd page fault) - Same explanation. [ 4 7 6 ] - Now 6 is brought into 3rd frame (3rd page fault) [ 1 7 6 ] - Now 1 is brought into 1st frame, as 1st frame was least recently used(4th page fault).

4,"Consider a paging hardware with a TLB. Assume that the entire page table and all the pages are in the physical memory. It takes 10 milliseconds to search the TLB and 80 milliseconds to access the physical memory. If the TLB hit ratio is 0.6, the effective memory access time (in milliseconds) is _________.",,120,,122,,124,,118,,B,MCQ,"TLB stands for Translation Lookaside Buffer . In Virtual memory systems, the cpu generates virtual memory addresses. But, the data is stored in actual physical memory i.e. we need to place a physical memory address on the memory bus to fetch the data from the memory circuitry. So, a special table is maintained by the operating system called the Page table. This table contains a mapping between the virtual addresses and physical addresses. So, every time a cpu generates a virtual address, the operating system page table has to be looked up to find the corresponding physical address. To speed this up, there is hardware support called the TLB. The TLB is a high speed cache of the page table i.e. contains recently accessed virtual to physical translations. TLB hit ratio- A TLB hit is the no of times a virtual-to-physical address translation was already found in the TLB, instead of going all the way to the page table which is located in slower physical memory. TLB hit ratio is nothing but the ratio of TLB hits/Total no of queries into TLB. In the case that the page is found in the TLB (TLB hit) the total time would be the time of search in the TLB plus the time to access memory, so TLB_hit_time := TLB_search_time + memory_access_time In the case that the page is not found in the TLB (TLB miss) the total time would be the time to search the TLB (you don't find anything, but searched nontheless) plus the time to access memory to get the page table and frame, plus the time to access memory to get the data, so TLB_miss_time := TLB_search_time + memory_access_time + memory_access_time But this is in individual cases, when you want to know an average measure of the TLB performance, you use the Effective Access Time, that is the weighted average of the previous measures  EAT := TLB_miss_time * (1- hit_ratio) + TLB_hit_time * hit_ratio.  EAT := (TLB_search_time + 2*memory_access_time) * (1- hit_ratio) + (TLB_search_time + memory_access_time)* hit_ratio.    As both page table and page are in physical memory T(eff) = hit ratio * (TLB access time + Main memory access time) +           (1 - hit ratio) * (TLB access time + 2 * main memory time)        = 0.6*(10+80) + (1-0.6)*(10+2*80)        = 0.6 * (90) + 0.4 * (170)        = 122",,Operating System,Memory Management,Virtual memory
