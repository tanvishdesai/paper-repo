65,Which one of the following statements is TRUE?,,The LALR(1) parser for a grammar G cannot have a reduce-reduce conflict if the LR(1) parser for G does not have reduce-reduce conflict.,,The symbol table is accessed only during the lexical analysis phase.,,Data flow analysis is necessary for run-time memory management.,,LR(1) parsing is sufficient for deterministic context-free languages.,,D,MCQ,Option A: False . Not necessary. Merging or combining the states with the same state and different lookahead may also lead to the R-R conflict in LALR(1) parser . Option B: False. Symbols table can be used with all phases of compilation and will be used at different stages. Not necessarily with lexical analysis phase only Option C: False . It is not necessary but we may apply it for the optimizations and finding the minimum number of registers and analyzing the code etc. Option D: True . The LR parser can recognize any deterministic context-free language in linear-bounded time.,,Algorithms,Design Techniques,Divide and conquer
