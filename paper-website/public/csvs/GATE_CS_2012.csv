Assume [Tex]\sum [/Tex] = {a} and [Tex]\epsilon[/Tex] is the empty string.,,[Tex]\phi[/Tex],,{ [Tex]{\epsilon}[/Tex] },,a*,,"{a, [Tex]\epsilon[/Tex] }",,B,MCQ,"1. Understanding the NFA States : Let’s label them as follows: q0 : initial state (leftmost) q1 : middle state (double circle, final) q2 : rightmost state Transitions : From q0 to q1 on a From q1 to q2 on ε From q2 to q0 on ε 2. Language Accepted Start at q0 Read a → go to q1 (which is a final state ) ⇒ so a is accepted From q1 , ε → q2 , ε → q0 again ⇒ can repeat the process with another a So, the automaton accepts: a , aa , aaa , ... = { aⁿ | n ≥ 1 } Thus, the accepted language is: L = a⁺ 3. Complement of the Language Given Σ = {a}, the full language over Σ is: a* = {ε, a, aa, aaa, ...} So, the complement of L = a⁺ is: a* − a⁺ = {ε} Final Answer: (B) {ε} Only the empty string is not accepted by the original NFA.",,Theory of Computation,Formal Languages and Automata,Regular languages and finite automata
60,Which of the following statements are TRUE about an SQL query? P : An SQL query can contain a HAVING clause even if it does not have a GROUP BY clause Q: An SQL query can contain a HAVING clause only if it has a GROUP BY clause R : All attributes used in the GROUP BY clause must appear in the SELECT clause S : Not all attributes used in the GROUP BY clause need to appear in the SELECT clause,,P & R,,P & S,,Q & R,,Q & S,,B,MCQ,"P: An SQL query can contain a HAVING clause even if it does not have a GROUP BY clause True HAVING is typically used with GROUP BY , but it can be used without GROUP BY . In such cases, the entire result set is treated as one group. Q: An SQL query can contain a HAVING clause only if it has a GROUP BY clause False This contradicts P and is incorrect for the reason explained above. R: All attributes used in the GROUP BY clause must appear in the SELECT clause False This is not required . You can group by columns not included in the SELECT clause, though it’s uncommon. S: Not all attributes used in the GROUP BY clause need to appear in the SELECT clause True As explained above, columns in GROUP BY don’t need to be in SELECT .

63,Which of the following is TRUE?,,Every relation in 3NF is also in BCNF,,A relation R is in 3NF if every non-prime attribute of R is fully functionally dependent on every key of R,,Every relation in BCNF is also in 3NF,,No relation can be in both BCNF and 3NF,,C,MCQ,"(A) False : 3NF allows some functional dependencies where a non-prime attribute depends on a part of a candidate key via a transitive dependency , which BCNF does not allow . (B) False : This is the condition for 2NF , not 3NF. 3NF also considers transitive dependencies . (C) ✅ True : BCNF is stricter than 3NF. So, if a relation is in BCNF , it must also satisfy 3NF . (D) False : A relation can be in both BCNF and 3NF — in fact, BCNF ⊆ 3NF . Final Answer: (C)",,Theory of Computation,Language Properties,Closure properties
