A spanning tree has exactly V - 1 edges. A single graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree. There can be more that one possible spanning trees of a graph. For example, the graph in this question has 6 possible spanning trees. MST has lightest edge of every cut set. Remember Prim's algorithm which basically picks the lightest edge from every cut set. Choices of this question : a) There exists a cut set in G having all edges of maximum weight : This is correct. If there is a heaviest edge in MST, then there exist a cut with all edges with weight equal to heavies edge.  See point 4 discussed in above background. b) There exists a cycle in G having all edges of maximum weight : Not always TRUE. The cut set of heaviest edge may contain only one edge.
