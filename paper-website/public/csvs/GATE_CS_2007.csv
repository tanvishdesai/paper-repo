Inserting K15: After inserting K15, the tree will need to adjust to accommodate the new key in a way that maintains the properties of the B-tree.

Deleting a key may cause a reorganization that could affect the height of the tree. However, in most cases where a key is deleted from a non-root node, the height typically remains the same. (ii) The node (disregarding the links) is present in the tree: This could also be true. In a B-tree, nodes don't get physically removed immediately after deletion; instead, the key is removed from the node, and only the links might change. (iii) The root node remains unchanged (disregarding the links): The root node might change if the deletion causes the root node to become underpopulated, requiring the root to merge or redistribute keys. Therefore, this statement could be false in such cases. Correct Answer: The correct option is a) Statements (i) and (ii) are true because, generally, the height of the tree may remain unchanged, and the node (ignoring links) could still be in the tree after a key deletion.",,Databases,File Organization and Indexing,
