Associativity : This property holds for the operation Δ, as set union is associative. Identity Element : The identity element e would be the empty set {}. For any A in H, A Δ {} = (A - {}) ∪ ({} - A) = A ∪ A = A. So, the identity element exists. Inverse Element : For an element A in H, the inverse element would be A itself because A Δ A = (A - A) ∪ (A - A) = {} ∪ {} = {} (the identity element). So, every element has an inverse. As all four group conditions are satisfied, Statement A is correct. Statement B: Because A is correct; Therefore, Statement B is incorrect. Statement C: For every A ∈ 2X, the inverse of A is the complement of A. This statement is not correct. The inverse of A under the operation Δ is A itself, not its complement. We already showed this in Statement A. Statement D: For every A ∈ 2X, the inverse of A is A. This statement is correct.

F is NOT well-defined. This statement is FALSE. F is well-defined because for each equivalence class [x], we define F([x]) = f(x), which means the value assigned by F to each equivalence class is uniquely determined by the representative element x in that class. B. F is an onto (or surjective) function. This statement is TRUE. As explained earlier, F is onto (surjective) because for every element b ∈ B, there exists an equivalence class [x] in E such that F([x]) = f(x) = b. Since f is onto, all elements of B can be mapped to by F. C. F is a one-to-one (or injective) function. This statement is FALSE. F is not one-to-one (injective) because different equivalence classes [x] and [y] can map to the same value under F if f(x) = f(y). In other words, if there exist elements a1 and a2 in A such that f(a1) = f(a2), then F([a1]) = f(a1) = f(a2) = F([a2]). D. F is bijective. This statement is FALSE.

This procedure results in a proper vertex coloring of G. A proper vertex coloring is a coloring of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The greedy coloring strategy ensures that each vertex is assigned the smallest possible color that is not already used by its neighbors. Therefore, this procedure does result in a proper vertex coloring of G. B. The number of colors used is at most Δ(G) + 1. Since the graph G is finite and simple, the maximum degree Δ(G) represents the highest number of neighbors any vertex can have. In the worst-case scenario, when all neighbors of a vertex have distinct colors, the vertex itself will need one additional color not used by its neighbors. Therefore, the number of colors used by this procedure is at most Δ(G) + 1. C. The number of colors used is at most Δ(G). As explained in statement B, the number of colors used can be at most Δ(G) + 1. However, it is not guaranteed that the extra color (Δ(G) + 1) is always used. In some cases, it might be possible to achieve a proper vertex coloring with just Δ(G) colors if the extra color is not needed. D. The number of colors used is equal to the chromatic number of G. The chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the graph. The greedy coloring procedure described here does not necessarily guarantee that it achieves the chromatic number of G. In some cases, it might use more colors than the chromatic number, especially if the graph has certain special structures. Now, let's summarize the correctness of each statement: A. True - The procedure results in a proper vertex coloring of G. B. True - The number of colors used is at most Δ(G) + 1. C.

The total  execution  time  for  executing  100  instructions  on  this  processor  is _____________ ns",,1020,,102,,2023,,2040,,D,MCQ,"Given delays=10ns,20ns,14ns total instructions=100 We know that pipeline delay as tp = max (10,20,14) number of stages(k)=3 So, total execution stages (k+(n-1)tp) (3+100-1)*20ns 2040ns",,Computer Organization and Architecture,Pipelining,Basics of pipelining
