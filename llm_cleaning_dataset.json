The first level (L1) cache access time is 1 nanosecond (ns) and the “hit rate” for L1 cache is 90% while the processor is accessing the data from L1 cache. Whereas, for the second level (L2) cache, the “hit rate” is 80% and the “miss penalty” for transferring data from L2 cache to L1 cache is 10 ns. The “miss penalty” for the data to be transferred from main memory to L2 cache is 100 ns.\n\nThen the average memory access time in this system in nanoseconds is ________.
