1,"In the working-set strategy, which of the following is done by the operating system to prevent thrashing? It initiates another process if there are enough extra frames. It selects a process to suspend if the sum of the sizes of the working-sets exceeds the total number of available frames.",,I only,,II only,,Neither I nor II,,Both I and II,,D,MCQ,"According to concept of thrashing, I is true because to prevent thrashing we must provide processes with as many frames as they really need ""right now"".If there are enough extra frames, another process can be initiated. II is true because The total demand, D, is the sum of the sizes of the working sets for all processes. If D exceeds the total number of available frames, then at least one process is thrashing, because there are not enough frames available to satisfy its minimum working set. If D is significantly less than the currently available frames, then additional processes can be launched.",

6,Which of the following DMA transfer modes and interrupt handling mechanisms will enable the highest I/O band-width?,,Transparent DMA and Polling interrupts,,Cycle-stealing and Vectored interrupts,,Block transfer and Vectored interrupts,,Block transfer and Polling interrupts,,C,MCQ,"Among the options provided, the DMA transfer mode and interrupt handling mechanism that enable the highest I/O bandwidth is option (C): Block transfer and Vectored interrupts. Let's understand why this choice provides the highest I/O bandwidth: Transparent DMA: Transparent DMA is not the most efficient option for achieving high I/O bandwidth. It allows the DMA controller to directly access the memory and transfer data without CPU involvement. However, it doesn't utilize interrupts effectively for signaling completion or handling data transfer events. Cycle-stealing: Cycle-stealing DMA interrupts the CPU during its normal operation to transfer data. While it can improve I/O bandwidth, it interrupts the CPU frequently, affecting its performance. Block transfer: Block transfer DMA involves transferring a block of data in a single operation. It minimizes the number of interrupts needed for transferring large amounts of data, resulting in efficient data transfer. Polling interrupts: Polling interrupts require the CPU to check the status of the DMA controller repeatedly to determine if data transfer has completed. This approach involves continuous CPU involvement and wastes CPU cycles, making it less efficient for achieving high I/O bandwidth. Vectored interrupts: Vectored interrupts allow the DMA controller to directly inform the CPU about data transfer events, reducing the CPU overhead. The CPU can efficiently handle the interrupts and resume its normal operations. Considering the characteristics described above, option (C) combines block transfer DMA, which minimizes interrupts for large data transfers, with vectored interrupts, which efficiently notify the CPU about data transfer events. This combination maximizes the I/O bandwidth by reducing CPU involvement and efficiently utilizing interrupts, making it the best choice among the provided options for achieving the highest I/O bandwidth.",

Before moving on to further statements we first discuss about the operators and their precedence .    “->” is structure operator which gets the member of the structure being referred. It has higher priority than increment/decrement (++, --) and dereferencing operation (*).  Now a brief discussion about post increment and pre increment operator.  Pre-increment operator is used to increment the value of variable before using in the expression. In the Pre-Increment value is first incremented and then used inside the expression.  Post-increment operator is used to increment the value of variable as soon as after executing expression completely in which post increment is used. In the Post-Increment value is first used in a expression and then incremented. ++p -> c; In this statement the structure operator (higher priority) will first make p point to the c variable inside the structure. Now pointer is inside the character array, now incrementing the pointer in character array ‘c’ will jump one character in character array. Hence the character array now starts from “e”. p->c moves pointer inside the structure to the variable “c”. printf(""%s,"", p++ -> c); In this statement there is post increment operator used. First the statement will be executed and then operator will work. Currently p is pointing to second structure { 4, better} and inside structure the character array is starting from e because of the previous statement so p->c will print the string “etter” and after that the post increment operator will increment the structure and p now will point to next structure. printf(""%c,"", *++p -> c); In this statement p->c points to “jungle” (p was currently pointing to 3rd structure {6, jungle}) and then the pre incrementing operator just like in previous pre increment statement moves one character and now the pointer points to “u”, dereferencing operator here prints the value at the address where the pointer is pointing and since the pointer is pointing at “u” so u is printed. printf(""%d,"", p[0].i); In this statement p[0] will give the address where p is currently pointing i.e {6, jungle} and the structure operator (.) will point to the “i” variable of the structure printing 6 as a result. printf(""%s \\n"", p -> c); This statements prints the character string of the structure to which p is currently pointing and since because of earlier increment of character array, character array starts from “u” therefore “ungle” is printed.",
