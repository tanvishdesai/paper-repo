5,"Consider a simple communication system where multiple nodes are connected by a shared broadcast medium (like Ethernet or wireless). The nodes in the system use the following carrier-sense the medium access protocol. A node that receives a packet to transmit will carrier-sense the medium for 5 units of time. If the node does not detect any other transmission in this duration, it starts transmitting its packet in the next time unit. If the node detects another transmission, it waits until this other transmission finishes, and then begins to carrier-sense for 5 time units again. Once they start to transmit, nodes do not perform any collision detection and continue transmission even if a collision occurs. All transmissions last for 20 units of time. Assume that the transmission signal travels at the speed of 10 meters per unit time in the medium. Assume that the system has two nodes P and Q, located at a distance d meters from each other. P starts transmitting a packet at time t = 0 after successfully completing its carrier-sense phase. Node Q has a packet to transmit at time t = 0 and begins to carrier-sense the medium. The maximum distance d (in meters, rounded to the closest integer) that allows Q to successfully avoid a collision between its proposed transmission and P’s on going transmission is _______ . Note - This was Numerical Type question.",,50,,150,,20,,60,,A,MCQ,"In this scenario, device Q has a carrier sensing window of 5 time units. To prevent a collision, it's crucial for the initial signal transmitted by device P to reach device Q within this 5-unit window. This allows Q to detect the ongoing transmission from P and consequently defer its own transmission, thereby avoiding a collision. Given the signal propagation speed of 10 meters per time unit, the maximum permissible distance between P and Q to ensure collision-free communication is 50 meters. So, option (A) is correct.

At the outset, the processes have declared their maximum resource requirements using a matrix named Max as given below. For example, Max[P 2 , F] is the maximum number of instances of F that P 2 would require. The number of instances of the resources allocated to the various processes at any given state is given by a matrix named Allocation. Consider a state of the system with the Allocation matrix as shown below, and in which 3 instances of E and 3 instances of F are the only resources available.

58,"Consider the following solution to the producer-consumer synchronization problem. The shared buffer size is N. Three semaphores empty, full and mutex are defined with respective initial values of 0, N and 1. Semaphore empty denotes the number of available slots in the buffer, for the consumer to read from. Semaphore full denotes the number of available slots in the buffer, for the producer to write to. The placeholder variables, denoted by P, Q, R and S, in the code below can be assigned either empty or full. The valid semaphore operations are: wait() and signal(). Which one of the following assignments to P, Q, R and S will yield the correct solution?",https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240320115309/8.jpg,"P: full , Q: full , R: empty , S: empty",,"P: empty , Q: empty , R: full , S: full",,"P: full , Q: empty , R: empty , S: full",,"P: empty , Q: full , R: full , S: empty",,C,MCQ,"Given, Empty = 0 Full = N Mutex = 1 Since value of empty semaphore is 0, so you cannot wait empty semaphore in first attempt.
