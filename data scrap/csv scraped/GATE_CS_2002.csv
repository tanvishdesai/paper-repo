1,"In serial data transmission, every byte of data is padded with a ‘0’ in the beginning and one or two ‘I’ s at the end of byte because",,Receiver is to be synchronized for byte reception,,Receiver recovers lost ‘0’ and ‘1’s from these padded bits,,Padded bits are useful in parity computation,,None of these,,A,MCQ,"In serial communication, the sender & receiver needs to be synchronized with each other. '0' is added in the beginning of data as start bit and  '1' is added at the end as a stop bit. The start signal tells the receiver about the arrival of data and the stop signal resets the receiver's state for the arrival of a new data. Thus, in serial communication receiver is to be synchronized for byte reception.",
2,To evaluate an expression without any embedded function calls :,,As many stacks as the height of the expression tree are needed,,One stack is enough,,Two stacks are needed,,A Turing machine is needed in the general case,,B,MCQ,"Any expression can be converted into Postfix or Prefix form. Prefix and postfix evaluation can be done using a single stack. For example : Expression '10 2 8 * + 3 -' is given. PUSH 10 in the stack. PUSH 2 in the stack. PUSH 8 in the stack. When operator '*' occurs, POP 2 and 8 from the stack. PUSH 2 * 8 = 16 in the stack. When operator '+' occurs, POP 16 and 10 from the stack. PUSH 10 * 16 = 26 in the stack. PUSH 3 in the stack. When operator '-' occurs, POP 26 and 3 from the stack. PUSH 26 - 3 = 23 in the stack. So, 23 is the answer obtained using single stack. Thus, option (B) is correct.",
3,Dynamic linking can cause security concerns because:,,Security is dynamic,,The path for searching dynamic libraries is not known till runtime,,Linking is insecure,,Cryptographic procedures are not available for dynamic linking,,B,MCQ,"Static Linking and Static Libraries is the result of the linker making copy of all used library functions to the executable file. Static Linking creates larger binary files, and need more space on disk and main memory. Examples of static libraries (libraries which are statically linked) are, .a files in Linux and .lib files in Windows. Dynamic linking and Dynamic Libraries Dynamic Linking doesn’t require the code to be copied, it is done by just placing name of the library in the binary file. The actual linking happens when the program is run, when both the binary file and the library are in memory. Examples of Dynamic libraries (libraries which are linked at run-time) are, .so in Linux and .dll in Windows.  In Dynamic Linking, the path for searching dynamic libraries is not known till runtime",
4,The optimal page replacement algorithm will select the page that,,Has been used least number of times.,,Will not be used for the longest time in the future.,,Has not been used for the longest time in the past.,,Has been used most number of times.,,B,MCQ,"The optimal page replacement algorithm will select the page whose next occurrence will be after the longest time in future. For example, if we need to swap a page and there are two options from which we can swap, say one would be used after 10s and the other after 5s, then the algorithm will swap out the page that would be required 10s later. Thus, B is the correct choice.",
5,Which of the following is not a form of memory?,,instruction cache,,instruction register,,instruction opcode,,translation lookaside buffer,,C,MCQ,"Instruction Cache - Used for storing instructions that are frequently used  Instruction Register - Part of CPU's control unit that stores the instruction currently being executed  Instruction Opcode - It is the portion of a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be performed  Translation Lookaside Buffer - It is a memory cache that stores recent translations of virtual memory to physical addresses for faster access.     So, all the above except Instruction Opcode are memories.  Thus, C is the correct choice.     Please comment below if you find anything wrong in the above post.",
6,The C language is:,,A context free language,,A context sensitive language,,A regular language,,Parsable fully only by a Turing machine,,B,MCQ,"C and C++ are context-sensitive languages. There are several reasons: To parse C and C++, you start by using a very powerful preprocessor . These preprocessors are inevitably written by hand (they are not based on a theoretic foundation like regular expressions or context-free grammars). The grammar is ambiguous: it has LR conflicts, such as the if-then-else conflict. Parsers typically resolve this using context (an “else” matches the closest “if”). C and C++ lexers require lexical feedback to differentiate between typedef names and identifiers. That is, the context-sensitive lexer needs help from the “context-free” parser to distinguish between an identifier “foo” and a typedef name “foo”. In this snippet, int foo; typedef int foo; foo x; the first “foo” is an identifier while the second and third are typedef names. You need to parse typedef declarations to figure this out (and since types have nested parentheses, this is definitely at least as hard as parsing a context-free language). This means that the parser and lexer are mutually recursive, so it doesn’t make sense to say that the parser is context free while the lexer is context sensitive.",

(k steps of recursion (recursion depth)) = 3 k T (2 k-k ) + (1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3 k-1 ) = 3 k + ( ( 3 k - 1 ) / 2 ) = ( (2 * 3 k ) + 3 k - 1 )/2 = ( (3 * 3 k ) - 1 ) / 2 = (3 k+1 - 1) / 2 Hence, B is the correct choice.",

9,"From the following instance of a relation scheme R (A, B, C), we can conclude that : A B C 1 1 1 1 1 0 2 3 2 2 3 2",,A functionally determines B and B function­ally determines C,,A functionally determines B and B does not functionally determine C,,B does not functionally determine C,,A does not functionally determine B and B does not functionally determine C,,C,MCQ,"Generally Normalization is done on the schema itself. From the relational instance given,we may strike out FD s that do not hold. e.g.B does not functionally determine C(This is true). But we cannot say that A functionally determines B for the entire relation itself. This is because that, A->B holds for this instance, but in future there might be some tuples added to the instance that may violate A->B. So overall on the relation we cannot conclude that A->B, from the relational instance which is just a subset of an entire relation.",
10,"Relation R is decomposed using a set of functional dependencies, F and relation S is decomposed using another set of functional dependencies G.

To make a guaranteed identification, which one of the following tests should be used on the decompositions? (Assume that the closures of F and G are available).",,Dependency-preservation,,Lossless-join,,BCNF definition,,3NF definition,,C,MCQ,Answer is (C) since to identify BCNF we need BCNF definition. One relation which satisfies will be in BCNF and other will be in 3NF.  1st is wrong because dependency may be preserved by both 3NF and BCNF. 2nd is wrong Because both 3NF and BCNF decomposition can be lossless. 4th is wrong because 3NF and BCNF both are in 3NF also.,
11,"With regard to the expressive power of the formal relational query languages, which of the following statements is true?",,Relational algebra is more powerful than relational calculus,,Relational algebra has the same power as relational calculus,,Relational algebra has the same power as safe relational calculus,,None of the above,,C,MCQ,"A query can be formulated in relational calculus if and only if it can be formulated in relational algebra. So, relational algebra has the same power as relational calculus. But, it is possible to write syntactically correct relational calculus queries that have infinite number of answers. Such queries are unsafe. Queries that have an finite number of answers are safe relational calculus queries. Thus, Relational algebra has the same power as safe relational calculus.

When indexes are created, the maximum number of blocks given to a file depends upon the size of the index which tells how many blocks can be there and size of each block(i.e. same as depending upon the number of blocks for storing the indexes and size of each index block). Thus, option (B) is correct.",
13,Four fair coins are tossed simultaneously. The probability that at least one head and one tail turn up is :,,1/16,,1/8,,7/8,,15/16,,C,MCQ,There are only two cases (when all head or all tail) against the given output.  So the required probability is (16-2)/16 = 7/8.,
14,"The binary relation S = ф (empty set) on set A = {1, 2, 3} is :",,Neither reflexive nor symmetric,,Symmetric and reflexive,,Transitive and reflexive,,Transitive and symmetric,,D,MCQ,"Reflexive : A relation is reflexive if every element of set is paired with itself. Here none of the element of A is paired with themselves, so S is not reflexive. Symmetric : This property says that if there is a pair (a, b) in S, then there must be a pair (b, a) in S. Since there is no pair here in S, this is trivially true, so S is symmetric. Transitive : This says that if there are pairs (a, b) and (b, c) in S, then there must be pair (a,c) in S. Again, this condition is trivially true, so S is transitive. Thus, option (D) is correct. Please comment below if you find anything wrong in the above post.",
15,Which of the following is true?,,The set of all rational negative numbers forms a group under multiplication.,,The set of all non-singular matrices forms a group under multiplication.,,The set of all matrices forms a group under multiplication.,,Both (2) and (3) are true.,,B,MCQ,"A group is a set of elements such that any two elements of the group combine to form a third element of the same group. Also, a group must satisfy certain properties: Closure Property - Any two elements of the set when operated open by an operator form a third element that must also be in the set. Associative Property - For an expression with three or more operands having the same operator between them, the order of operation does not matter as long as the sequence of operands are not changed. For example, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). Identity element Property - Each set must have an identity element, which is an element of the set such that when operated upon with another element of the set, it gives the element itself. For example, a + 0 = a. Here, 0 is the identity element. Invertibility Property - For each element of the set, inverse should exist. Now, for the given statements, we have  A is incorrect as it does not satisfies closure property. If we take two negative numbers and multiply them, we get a positive number which is not in the set.  B is correct. The matrices in the set must be non - singular, i.e., their determinant should not be zero, for the inverse to exist (Invertibility Property). C is incorrect as the inverse of a singular (determinant = 0) matrix does not exist (Invertibility Property violated). Thus, B is the correct option.",

Below is proof for the answer. Let expected number of comparisons be E. Value of E is sum of following expression for all the possible cases. number_of_comparisons_for_a_case * probability_for_the_case Case 1 If A[i] is found in the first attempt number of comparisons = 1 probability of the case  = 1/n Case 2 If A[i] is found in the second attempt number of comparisons = 2 probability of the case  = (n-1)/n*1/n Case 3 If A[i] is found in the third attempt number of comparisons = 2 probability of the case  = (n-1)/n*(n-1)/n*1/n There are actually infinite such cases. So, we have following infinite series for E. E  = 1/n + [(n-1)/n]*[1/n]*2 + [(n-1)/n]*[(n-1)/n]*[1/n]*3 + ….  (1) After multiplying equation (1) with (n-1)/n, we get E (n-1)/n = [(n-1)/n]*[1/n] + [(n-1)/n]*[(n-1)/n]*[1/n]*2 + [(n-1)/n]*[(n-1)/n]*[(n-1)/n]*[1/n]*3 ……….(2) Subtracting (2) from (1), we get E/n = 1/n + (n-1)/n*1/n + (n-1)/n*(n-1)/n*1/n + ………… The expression on right side is a GP with infinite elements. Let us apply the sum formula (a/(1-r)) E/n = [1/n]/[1-(n-1)/n]  = 1 E = n",
