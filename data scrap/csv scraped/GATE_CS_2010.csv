1,"Consider the methods used by processes P1 and P2 for accessing their critical sections whenever needed, as given below. The initial values of shared boolean variables S1 and S2 are randomly assigned. Method Used by P1 while (S1 == S2) ; Critica1 Section S1 = S2; Method Used by P2 while (S1 != S2) ; Critica1 Section S2 = not (S1); Which one of the following statements describes the properties achieved?",,Mutual exclusion but not progress,,Progress but not mutual exclusion,,Neither mutual exclusion nor progress,,Both mutual exclusion and progress,,A,MCQ,"Mutual Exclusion: A way of making sure that if one process is using a shared modifiable data, the other processes will be excluded from doing the same thing. while one process executes the shared variable, all other processes desiring to do so at the same time moment should be kept waiting; when that process has finished executing the shared variable, one of the processes waiting; while that process has finished executing the shared variable, one of the processes waiting to do so should be allowed to proceed. In this fashion, each process executing the shared data (variables) excludes all others from doing so simultaneously. This is called Mutual Exclusion. Progress Requirement: If no process is executing in its critical section and there exist some processes that wish to enter their critical section, then the selection of the processes that will enter the critical section next cannot be postponed indefinitely. Solution: It can be easily observed that the Mutual Exclusion requirement is satisfied by the above solution, P1 can enter critical section only if S1 is not equal to S2, and P2 can enter critical section only if S1 is equal to S2. But here Progress Requirement is not satisfied. Suppose when s1=1 and s2=0 and process p1 is not interested to enter into critical section but p2 want to enter critical section. P2 is not able to enter critical section in this as only when p1 finishes execution, then only p2 can enter (then only s1 = s2 condition be satisfied). Progress will not be satisfied when any process which is not interested to enter into the critical section will not allow other interested process to enter into the critical section.",

The time taken for a single refresh operation is 100 nanoseconds. The time required to perform one refresh operation on all the cells in the memory unit is:- A. 100 nanoseconds B. 100×2 10 nanoseconds C. 100×2 20 nanoseconds D. 3200×2 20 nanoseconds,,A,,B,,C,,D,,B,MCQ,"Number of chips required for 4MB MM = (4 * 2 20 * 8) / (1 * 2 20 ) = 32 chips In a refresh cycle, a whole row of a memory chip is refreshed at once.

Second question arises, how to arrange these chips as there can be many possible arrangements. There is a logical arrangement provided in the problem statement itself as ""1M x 1 bit chip"". This indicates that to make a ""1M x 32 bits"" MM, we need to arrange all 32 chips in a line. It is to be noted that a row in all chips in series can be refreshed in one refresh cycle. This makes the total time to refresh the 4MBytes of memory as same as that of one chip. Hence, time required to refresh MM = 100 * 2 10 ns. So, option (B) is correct.",

It requires minimum of 3 registers. Principle of Register Allocation : If a variable needs to be allocated to a register, the system checks for any free register available, if it finds one, it allocates. If there is no free register, then it checks for a register that contains a dead variable ( a variable whose value is not going to be used in the future ), and if it finds one then it allocates. Otherwise, it goes for Spilling ( it checks for a register whose value is needed after the longest time, saves its value into the memory, and then use that register for current allocation, later when the old value of the register is needed, the system gets it from the memory where it was saved and allocate it in any register which is available ). But here we should not apply spilling as directed in the question. Let's allocate the registers for the variables. a = 1 ( let's say register R1 is allocated for variable 'a' ) b = 10 ( R2 for 'b' , because value of 'a' is going to be used in the future, hence can not replace variable of 'a' by that of 'b' in R1) c = 20 ( R3 for 'c', because values of 'a' and 'b' are going to be used in the future, hence can not replace variable 'a' or 'b' by 'c' in R1 or R2 respectively) d = a+b ( now, 'd' can be assigned to R1 because R1 contains a dead variable which is 'a' and it is so-called because it is not going to be used in future, i.e. no subsequent expression uses the value of variable 'a') e = c+d ( 'e' can be assigned to R1, because currently R1 contains value of variable 'd' which is not going to be used in the subsequent expression.) Note : an already calculated value of a variable is used only by READ operation ( not WRITE), hence we have to see only on the RHS side of the subsequent expressions whether the variable is going to be used or not. f = c+e ( ' f ' can be assigned to R2, because value of 'b' in register R2 is not going to be used in subsequent expressions, hence R2 can be used to allocate for ' f ' replacing 'b' ) b = c+e ( ' b ' can be assigned to R3, because value of 'c' in R3 is not being used later ) e = b+f ( here 'e' is already in R1, so no allocation here, direct assignment ) d = 5+e ( 'd' can be assigned to either R1 or R3, because values in both are not used further, let's assign in R1 ) return d+f ( no allocation here, simply contents of registers R1 and R2 are added and returned) hence we need only 3 registers, R1 R2 and R3.",

In the above question, I2 is dependent on I0 and I1, and I3 is dependent on I2.  Let's see this question with a time-space diagram. The above is a space-time diagram representing the pipeline in which the instructions gets executed.  Instruction 0 is a MUL operation which take 3 clock cycles of CPU in the PO stage, and at any other stage it takes only 1 cycle.  Instruction 1 is a DIV operation which take 6 clock cycles of CPU in the PO stage, and at any other stage it takes only 1 cycle.  It can be noticed here that even when the OF stage was free in the 4th clock cycle, then also the instruction 1 was not given to it. This is a design issue. The operands should be fetched only if they are going to get operated or executed in the next cycle, else there is a possibility of data corruption. As PO stage was not free in the next cycle hence OF was delayed and was done for instruction 1 only just before 1 cycle of going to PO stage.  Instruction 2 is an ADD operation which take 1 clock cycles of CPU in all stages. But it is a dependent operation. it needs the operands which are provided by Instruction 0 and 1.  Instruction 2 needs R5 and R2 to add, it gets R2 on time, because till the time Instruction 2 reaches its PO stage R2 would have been stored in memory. Now R5 is also needed, but Instruction 2's PO and Instruction 1's WO are in parallel. That means Instruction 2 can't take the value of R5 before it is stored by Instruction 1. So here comes the concept of Operand Forwarding. Before Instruction 1 store it's result/value which is R5, it can first forward it to instruction 2's Fetch-Execute Buffer, so that Instruction 2 can also use it in parallel to Instruction's WO stage. This will save extra clock cycles required( if Operand forwarding is not used, and R5 need to be taken from memory).  In Instruction 3, same operand forwarding concept is applied for the value of R2 which is computed by Instruction 2.  Hence operand forwarding saved 2 extra clock cycles here. ( 1 cycle in Instruction 2 and 1 cycle in Instruction 3).  So the total no of cycles are 15, which can be seen from the diagram, each instance of the stage represents 1 clock cycle.

63,Which of the following concurrency control protocols ensure both conflict serializability and freedom from deadlock? I. 2-phase locking II. Time-stamp ordering,,I only,,II only,,Both I and II,,Neither I nor II,,B,MCQ,"2 Phase Locking (2PL) is a concurrency control method that guarantees serializability. The protocol utilizes locks, applied by a transaction to data, which may block (interpreted as signals to stop) other transactions from accessing the same data during the transaction’s life. 2PL may be lead to deadlocks that result from the mutual blocking of two or more transactions. See the following situation, neither T3 nor T4 can make progress. It is a algorithm is a non-lock concurrency control method. In Timestamp based method, deadlock cannot occur as no transaction ever waits.",https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/GATECS_2010_Question_20.jpg
64,"Consider the following matrix [Tex]A = \begin{bmatrix} 2  & 3 \\ x & y \end{bmatrix}[/Tex] If the eigenvalues of A are 4 and 8, then",,"x=-3, y=9",,"x= -4, y=10",,"x=5, y=8",,"x=4, y=10",,B,MCQ,"The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix, and it is also the sum of the eigenvalues. Thus, 2 + y = 4 + 8 ⇒ 2 + y = 12 ⇒ y = 10 The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues. Thus, 2y − 3x = 8 × 4 ⇒ 2(10) - 3x = 32 ⇒ 20 - 3x = 32 ⇒ 3x = 20 - 32 = -12 ⇒ x = -4 Thus, x = -4 and y = 10",
65,"In a binary tree with n nodes, every node has an odd number of descendants. Every node is considered to be its own descendant. What is the number of nodes in the tree that have exactly one child?",,0,,1,,(n-1)/2,,n-1,,A,MCQ,"It is mentioned that each node has odd number of descendants including node itself, so all nodes must have even number of descendants 0, 2, 4 so on.   Which means each node should have either 0 or 2 children. So there will be no node with 1 child.  Hence 0 is answer.  Following are few examples. a /    \\ b      c a /   \\ b     c /  \\ d    e Such a binary tree is full binary tree (a binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children).",
