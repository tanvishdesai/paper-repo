This instruction pops the address from the stack and jumps to that address. Let's analyze the number of machine cycles required for the **RET** instruction: 1. **Opcode Fetch Cycle**: The 8085 first fetches the opcode for the RET instruction from memory. This takes **1 machine cycle**. 2. **Memory Read Cycles**: The RET instruction needs to read the return address from the stack, which is stored in two consecutive memory locations (since the 8085 is an 8-bit processor and the address is 16-bit). Each memory read cycle takes **1 machine cycle**. Since the address is 16-bit, it requires two memory read cycles to fetch the complete address. Therefore, the total number of machine cycles required for the RET instruction is: - 1 machine cycle for the opcode fetch - 2 machine cycles for the memory read (to read the return address from the stack) In summary: \[ 1 \, (\text{Opcode Fetch}) + 2 \, (\text{Memory Read}) = 3 \, \text{machine cycles} \] Thus, the **RET** instruction in the 8085 microprocessor requires a total of **3 machine cycles**.",
