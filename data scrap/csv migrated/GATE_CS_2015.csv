16,Consider the following partial Schedule S involving two transactions T1 and T2. Only the read and the write operations have been shown.

Durability states that once transaction commits, its change cannot be undone (without running another, compensating, transaction). Recoverable schedule: A schedules exactly where, for every set of transaction Ti and Tj. If Tj reads a data items previously written by Ti, then the commit operation of Ti precedes the commit operation of Tj. Aborting involves undoing the operations and redoing them since by the time stamp it is aborted. Option (A) : T2 must be aborted and then both T1 and T2 must be re-started to ensure transaction atomicity. It is incorrect because it says abort transaction T2 and then redo all the operations. But there is no guarantee that it will succeed this time as again T1 may be fail. Option(B) : Schedule S is non-recoverable and cannot ensure transaction atomicity. Correct, it is by definition an irrecoverable schedule so now even if we start to undo the actions one by one(after t1 fails) in order to ensure transaction atomicity. Still we cannot undo a committed transaction. hence this schedule is irrecoverable by definition and also not atomic since it leaves the database in an inconsistent state. Simply dirty read so nonrecoverable. Option (C) : Only T2 must be aborted and then re-started to ensure transaction atomicity. It is incorrect because it says abort only transaction T2 and then redo all the T2 operations. But this is dirty read problem as it is reading the data item A which is written by T1 and T1 is not committed. Again it will be the dirty read problem. So incorrect. Option (D) : Schedule S is recoverable and can ensure transaction atomicity and nothing else needs to be done. Incorrect, it is clearly saying that schedule s is recoverable but it is irrecoverable because T2 read the data item A which is written by T1 and T1 failed and rollback, at the rollback T1 start undo all operations and modified the value of A with previous value but T2 is already committed so T2 can't change the read value of A which was earlier taken from T1.",

Complement of L, \bar{L}: The complement contains all strings over {0,1} that do not contain the substring 0011 . Step 2: DFA for L To construct the DFA for L: A DFA needs to track whether the substring 0011 has occurred while scanning the input. To achieve this, the DFA needs to recognize the sequence of states that correspond to progressively matching the characters in 0011. States for L: The DFA for L has 5 states : State 0: No part of 0011 has been matched. State 1: Matched the prefix 0. State 2: Matched the prefix 00. State 3: Matched the prefix 001. State 4: Matched the full substring 0011 (accepting state). Step 3: DFA for \bar{L} The DFA for Lˉ\bar{L}Lˉ is the complement of the DFA for LLL. This means the accepting and non-accepting states of the DFA for LLL are swapped. The complement DFA will accept all strings that do not reach state 4 . States for \bar{L}: The DFA for L already has the minimum number of states necessary to determine whether 0011 appears in a string. Complementing the DFA does not reduce the number of states , so the DFA for \bar{L} will also require 5 states . Final Answer : 5",
