Which one of the following options is correct? (Note: ≡ denotes logical equivalence)",,S 1 ≡ S 3,,S 2 ≡ S 3,,S 2 ≡ S 4,,S 1 ≡ S 4,,A,MCQ,"To determine which of the given statements are logically equivalent, let's analyze each statement in terms of their truth values and implications: S1: p → q - This statement is true when either 'p' is false or both 'p' and 'q' are true. It translates to ""if p then q"". S2: ¬p ∧ q - This statement is true only when 'p' is false and 'q' is true simultaneously. It is a stricter condition than the others. S3: ¬p ∨ q - This is true when either 'p' is false, or 'q' is true, or both. It can be rewritten using implication as p→qp \rightarrow qp→q, which is a classic transformation in logic (Implication Rule). S4: ¬p ∨ ¬q - This statement is true when at least one of 'p' or 'q' is false. Now let's match these explanations against the logical equivalences: S1 ≡ S3 : S1 (p → q) can be rewritten by definition as ¬p ∨ q, which is exactly S3. Thus, S1 is logically equivalent to S3. S2 ≡ S3 : S2 (¬p ∧ q) differs from S3 (¬p ∨ q) in that S2 requires both 'p' to be false and 'q' to be true, whereas S3 is satisfied with either condition independently. Thus, S2 is not equivalent to S3. S2 ≡ S4 : S2 (¬p ∧ q) and S4 (¬p ∨ ¬q) are quite different, as S2 needs both 'p' to be false and 'q' to be true, while S4 only needs at least one of the conditions 'p is false' or 'q is false'. Thus, S2 is not equivalent to S4. S1 ≡ S4 : S1 (p → q) as ¬p ∨ q and S4 (¬p ∨ ¬q) have different conditions for 'q'. Thus, S1 is not equivalent to S4. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is: S1 ≡ S3 This is the only pair that represents the same logical operation, i.e., implication, expressed in two different syntactical forms.",

27,For which of the following inputs does binary search take time O(logn) in the worst case?,,An array of n integers in any order,,A linked list of n integers in any order,,An array of n integers in increasing order,,A linked list of n integers in increasing order,,C,MCQ,"(A) An array of n integers in any order Binary search requires the input to be sorted in order to work correctly. If the array is in any random order, binary search will not be applicable because it relies on the fact that the elements are ordered to efficiently decide which half of the array to search next. Time complexity: Not applicable (binary search cannot be applied without sorting the array first). (B) A linked list of n integers in any order Binary search operates by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. For a linked list , accessing the middle element requires traversing the list from the head to the middle element. This takes O(n) time for each step, making the overall time complexity for binary search on a linked list O(n) . Time complexity: O(n) (not O(log n) . (C) An array of n integers in increasing order Binary search works optimally on a sorted array , and when the array is sorted in increasing order, the binary search can effectively reduce the search space in half at each step. Time complexity: O(log n) in the worst case. (D) An linked list of n integers increasing order Even though the linked list is sorted, binary search would still require O(n) time to access the middle element in each step. Since the linked list does not support direct access to arbitrary indices (like arrays do), binary search is inefficient here. Time complexity: O(n) (not O(log n) ). Final Answer: Binary search takes time O(log n) in the worst case only for an array of n integers in increasing order.",

Which one of the following statements is ALWAYS correct?,,A is invertible,,Determinant of A is 0,,The sum of the diagonal elements of A is 1,,A and A 2 have the same rank,,D,MCQ,"Given A^3 = A, we can factorize this as A(A^2 - I) = 0. This implies that every eigenvalue λ of A must satisfy the equation λ(λ^2 - 1) = 0, leading to possible eigenvalues λ = 0, 1, or -1. A is invertible: A matrix is invertible if and only if it has no zero eigenvalues. Since one of the possible eigenvalues of A is 0 (due to the polynomial equation), A can have zero as an eigenvalue, hence it is not necessarily invertible. Determinant of A is 0: Since zero can be an eigenvalue of A, and the determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues, det(A) can indeed be zero. However, if A has no zero eigenvalues (all eigenvalues are ±1), then det(A) ≠ 0. Thus, this statement is also not always correct. The sum of the diagonal elements of A is 1: The sum of the diagonal elements of a matrix (the trace) is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. Since the eigenvalues of A can be 0, 1, or -1 in any combination, their sum (the trace) is not necessarily 1. For instance, if all eigenvalues are 0, the trace is 0. If there are equal numbers of 1 and -1, the trace could be 0. Thus, this statement is not always correct. A and A^2 have the same rank: Since A^3 = A, and considering the eigenvalues 0, 1, -1, A^2 will also have eigenvalues of 0, 1, 1 (since (-1)^2 = 1). Matrices A and A^2 have the same nullity because the null space of A and A^2 is determined by the zero eigenvalue. The presence of λ = 0 in A corresponds to the presence of λ^2 = 0 in A^2. Both A and A^2 annihilate the same vector space, hence they have the same nullity and thus the same rank. D is correct.",

Here’s how we can approach this analysis: Analyzing the Paths: Path a - b - c - d is the shortest path between a and d. This implies that direct connections that could potentially shorten this path, such as b - d, do not exist. Path e - f - g - h is the shortest path between e and h. This implies there are no direct connections between e and g that could shorten the path from e to h through g. Path a - f - c - h is the shortest path between a and h. This suggests there are no shorter connections between these nodes that pass through fewer edges. For instance, if there was a direct link like b - h, it might provide a shorter path from a to h that would bypass f and c. Evaluating the Options: (A) (b, d) If there were an edge from b to d, the path from a to d could be shorter, directly going from a - b - d, contradicting the given that a - b - c - d is the shortest path. This edge likely does not exist. (B) (b, g) There’s no direct mention or implication about the relationship between b and g from the shortest paths provided. b and g do not appear on any shared shortest path. Cannot definitively determine based on given paths. (C) (b, h) Given a - f - c - h is the shortest path between a and h, a direct b - h link could potentially offer a shortcut on the path a - b - h, which would be shorter than the one passing through f and c. This edge likely does not exist. (D) (e, g) If there were an edge from e to g, the shortest path between e and h could simply be e - g - h, which is shorter than e - f - g - h. Thus, this edge likely does not exist. Conclusion: Based on the analysis and understanding of how the shortest paths are affected by the existence of certain edges: (A) (b, d) and (C) (b, h) and (D) (e, g) are the edges that are most likely NOT part of the graph G, as their existence would contradict the defined shortest paths.",

63,"Consider the following Python code snippet. def f(a,b): if (a==0): return b if (a%2==1): return 2*f((a-1)/2,b) return b+f(a-1,b) print(f(15,10)) The value printed by the code snippet is _________. (Answer in integer)",,160,,,,,,,,A,MCQ,"To find out what value the Python function f prints when called with arguments 15 and 10, we need to analyze how the function behaves based on the input parameters a and b. Understanding the Function The function f takes two parameters, a and b, and has three conditional branches: Base Case: If a is 0, it returns b. Odd Case: If a is odd (a % 2 == 1), it calls itself recursively as 2 * f((a-1)/2, b). Even Case: If a is even and not zero, it calls itself recursively as b + f(a-1, b). Evaluating f(15, 10) Let's trace through the calls: f(15, 10): Since 15 is odd, the function goes to 2 * f((15-1)/2, 10). This becomes 2 * f(7, 10). f(7, 10): 7 is odd, so it goes to 2 * f((7-1)/2, 10). This becomes 2 * f(3, 10). f(3, 10): 3 is odd, so it goes to 2 * f((3-1)/2, 10). This becomes 2 * f(1, 10). f(1, 10): 1 is odd, so it goes to 2 * f((1-1)/2, 10). This becomes 2 * f(0, 10). f(0, 10): Reaches the base case, so it returns 10. So the call structure looks like this: f(15, 10) → 2 * f(7, 10) f(7, 10) → 2 * 2 * f(3, 10) f(3, 10) → 2 * 2 * 2 * f(1, 10) f(1, 10) → 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * f(0, 10) f(0, 10) → 10 Thus, multiplying through: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 10 = 16 * 10 = 160 The function f(15, 10) returns 160, so the value printed by the code snippet is 160.",
