In this way, we will lay every successor of reaching to the predecessor of b and all the elements between a and b will be reported. For k elements, the in-order sorting will take O(k) time.

10,Consider a database implemented using B+ tree for file indexing and installed on a disk drive with block size of 4 KB. The size of search key is 12 bytes and the size of tree/disk pointer is 8 bytes. Assume that the database has one million records. Also assume that no node of the B+ tree and no records are present initially in main memory. Consider that each record fits into one disk block. The minimum number of disk accesses required to retrieve any record in the database is ___________ . Note - This question was Numerical Type.,,4,,6,,8,,7,,A,MCQ,"In this question, the size of the tree pointer and disk pointer is the same, so the order of the leaf and non-leaf nodes will be the same. Let’s assume the order of the non-leaf node is P, where P represents the number of tree pointers that can be contained in a node. Now, we can set up the equation for the total size of a node: (P×8)+((P−1)×12)=4096. Simplifying the equation: 8P+12P−12=4096,20P−12=4096,20P=4108,P=4108/20=205.4. Thus, P=205 meaning the order of the node is 205. Given that the database contains 1 million records, the number of search keys at the last level of the tree should be 1 million. To minimize the number of disk accesses, we need to ensure that the nodes of the B+ tree are fully filled. Level No. of Child Pointer No. of Search Key 1 205 204 2 205 2 205*204 3 205 3 205 2 *204=8573100 So, for 1 million records total 3 level requires.

Here's an alternative approach: For a minimum spanning tree (MST) with V vertices, there are V−1 edges. Traversing the adjacency list has a time complexity of O(V+E), and since we are dealing with V−1 edges, the traversal effectively takes O(V) time. The tree is given instead of the Entire graph and in a tree E=V-1, Hence TC = [Tex]\theta[/Tex] (V + E) = [Tex]\Theta[/Tex] (V + V-1) = Θ(V) While traversing the adjacency list of T, compare the weight of the newly added edge with the weights of the edges in the MST.

Note: Option D is incorrect due to the ""if and only if"" clause. If it were just ""if,"" the statement would be correct. The condition provided is sufficient but not necessary, making the ""only if"" part invalid.
