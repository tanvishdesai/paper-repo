So total completion time for 20k job = (10+1+8) = 19 unit answer.

Assertion (i): R1 ∪ R2 is an equivalence relation Reflexivity : For R1 ∪ R2​ to be reflexive, every element a ∈ S must be related to itself. Since R1​ and R2​ are equivalence relations, both contain the pairs (a, a) for all a ∈ S. Hence, R1 ∪ R2​ will also contain these pairs and is reflexive. Symmetry : For R1 ∪ R2 to be symmetric, if (a, b) ∈ R1 ∪ R2​, then (b, a) must also be in R1 ∪ R2​. Both R1​ and R2​ are symmetric, so if (a, b) ∈ R1 ∪ R2​, then (a, b) ∈ R1 or (a, b) ∈ R2​. In either case, (b, a) ∈ R1​ or (b, a) ∈ R2​, hence (b, a) ∈ R1 ​∪ R2​. Therefore, R1 ​∪ R2​ is symmetric. Transitivity : For R1 ​∪ R2​ to be transitive, if (a, b) ∈ R1​ ∪ R2​ and (b, c) ∈ R1​ ∪ R2​, then (a, c) must be in R1​ ∪ R2​. This is not necessarily true. For example, suppose (a, b) ∈ R1​ and (b, c)∈R2​, there is no guarantee that (a, c) ∈ R1​ or (a, c) ∈ R2​. Thus, R1 ​∪ R2​ is not necessarily transitive. Therefore, assertion (i) is false because R1 ∪ R2​ may not be transitive. Assertion (ii): R1 ​∩ R2​ is an equivalence relation Reflexivity : Both R1​ and r2​ are reflexive, so (a, a) ∈ R1 and (a, a) ∈ R2 for all a ∈ S. Thus, (a, a) ∈ R1 ∩ R2​, making R1 ∩ R2​ reflexive. Symmetry : Both R1​ and R2​ are symmetric, so if (a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ R2​, then (a, b) ∈ R1​ and (a, b) ∈ R2​. Thus, (b, a) ∈ R1​ and (b, a) ∈ R2​, so (b, a) ∈ R1 ∩ R2​. Therefore, R1 ∩ R2​ is symmetric. Transitivity : Both R1​ and R2​ are transitive, so if (a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ R2​ and (b, c) ∈ R1 ∩ R2​, then (a, b) ∈ R1​ and (b, c) ∈ R1, hence (a,c) ∈ R1​. Similarly, (a, b) ∈ R2 and (b, c) ∈ R2 implies (a, c) ∈ R2​. Thus, (a, c) ∈ R1 ∩ R2​, making R1 ∩ R2​ transitive. Therefore, assertion (ii) is true because R1 ∩ R2​ retains the properties of an equivalence relation. The correct answer is that only assertion (ii) is true.",
