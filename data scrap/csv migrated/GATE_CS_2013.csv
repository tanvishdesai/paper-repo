1,"A certain computation generates two arrays a and b such that a[i]=f(i) for 0 ≤ i < n and b[i]=g(a[i]) for 0 ≤ i < n. Suppose this computation is decomposed into two concurrent processes X and Y such that X computes the array a and Y computes the array b. The processes employ two binary semaphores R and S, both initialized to zero. The array a is shared by the two processes. The structures of the processes are shown below. Process X: Process Y: private i;                         private i; for (i=0; i < n; i++) {            for (i=0; i < n; i++) { a[i] = f(i);                       EntryY(R, S); ExitX(R, S);                       b[i]=g(a[i]); }                                 } Which one of the following represents the CORRECT implementations of ExitX and EntryY? (A) ExitX(R, S) { P(R); V(S); } EntryY (R, S) { P(S); V(R); } (B) ExitX(R, S) { V(R); V(S); } EntryY(R, S) { P(R); P(S); } (C) ExitX(R, S) { P(S); V(R); } EntryY(R, S) { V(S); P(R); } (D) ExitX(R, S) { V(R); P(S); } EntryY(R, S) { V(S); P(R); }",,A,,B,,C,,D,,C,MCQ,The purpose here is neither the deadlock should occur nor the binary semaphores be assigned value greater than one. A leads to deadlock B can increase value of semaphores b/w 1 to n D may increase the value of semaphore R and S to 2 in some cases See http://geeksquiz.com/operating-systems-process-management-question-13/,
2,"A shared variable x, initialized to zero, is operated on by four concurrent processes W, X, Y, Z as follows. Each of the processes W and X reads x from memory, increments by one, stores it to memory, and then terminates. Each of the processes Y and Z reads x from memory, decrements by two, stores it to memory, and then terminates. Each process before reading x invokes the P operation (i.e., wait) on a counting semaphore S and invokes the V operation (i.e., signal) on the semaphore S after storing x to memory. Semaphore S is initialized to two. What is the maximum possible value of x after all processes complete execution?",,-2,,-1,,1,,2,,D,MCQ,"Background Explanation: A critical section in which the process may be changing common variables, updating table, writing a file and perform another function. The important problem is that if one process is executing in its critical section, no other process is to be allowed to execute in its critical section. Each process must request permission to enter its critical section. A semaphore is a tool for synchronization and it is used to remove the critical section problem which is that no two processes can run simultaneously together so to remove this two signal operations are used named as wait and signal which is used to remove the mutual exclusion of the critical section. as an unsigned one of the most important synchronization primitives, because you can build many other Decrementing the semaphore is called acquiring or locking it, incrementing is called releasing or unlocking. Solution : Since initial value of semaphore is 2, two processes can enter critical section at a time- this is bad and we can see why. Say, X and Y be the processes.X increments x by 1 and Z decrements x by 2. Now, Z stores back and after this X stores back. So, final value of x is 1 and not -1 and two Signal operations make the semaphore value 2 again. So, now W and Z can also execute like this and the value of x can be 2 which is the maximum possible in any order of execution of the processes. (If the semaphore is initialized to 1, processed would execute correctly and we get the final value of x as -2.) Option (D) is the correct answer. Another Solution: Processes can run in many ways, below is one of the cases in which x attains max value Semaphore S is initialized to 2 Process W executes S=1, x=1 but it doesn't update the x variable. Then process Y executes S=0, it decrements x, now x= -2 and signal semaphore S=1 Now process Z executes s=0, x=-4, signal semaphore S=1 Now process W updates x=1, S=2 Then process X executes X=2 So correct option is D Another Solution: S is a counting semaphore initialized to 2 i.e., Two process can go inside a critical section protected by S. W, X read the variable, increment by 1 and write it back. Y, Z can read the variable, decrement by 2 and write it back. Whenever Y or Z runs the count gets decreased by 2. So, to have the maximum sum, we should copy the variable into one of the processes which increases the count, and at the same time the decrementing processed should run parallel, so that whatever they write back into memory can be overridden by incrementing process. So, in effect decrement would never happen.

3,"Three concurrent processes X, Y, and Z execute three different code segments that access and update certain shared variables. Process X executes the P operation (i.e., wait) on semaphores a, b and c; process Y executes the P operation on semaphores b, c and d; process Z executes the P operation on semaphores c, d, and a before entering the respective code segments. After completing the execution of its code segment, each process invokes the V operation (i.e., signal) on its three semaphores. All semaphores are binary semaphores initialized to one. Which one of the following represents a deadlock-free order of invoking the P operations by the processes?",,X: P(a)P(b)P(c) Y: P(b)P(c)P(d) Z: P(c)P(d)P(a),,X: P(b)P(a)P(c) Y: P(b)P(c)P(d) Z: P(a)P(c)P(d),,X: P(b)P(a)P(c) Y: P(c)P(b)P(d) Z: P(a)P(c)P(d),,X: P(a)P(b)P(c) Y: P(c)P(b)P(d) Z: P(c)P(d)P(a),,B,MCQ,"Option A can cause deadlock. Imagine a situation process X has acquired a, process Y has acquired b and process Z has acquired c and d. There is circular wait now. Option C can also cause deadlock. Imagine a situation process X has acquired b, process Y has acquired c and process Z has acquired a. There is circular wait now. Option D can also cause deadlock. Imagine a situation process X has acquired a and b, process Y has acquired c. X and Y circularly waiting for each other. See http://www.eee.metu.edu.tr/~halici/courses/442/Ch5%20Deadlocks.pdf Consider option A) for example here all 3 processes are concurrent so X will get semaphore a, Y will get b and Z will get c, now X is blocked for b, Y is blocked for c, Z gets d and blocked for a. Thus it will lead to deadlock. Similarly one can figure out that for B) completion order is Z,X then Y.

These are the sets of LR(1) ( LR(1) is also called CLR(1) ) items.  The LALR(1) parser combines those set of LR(1) items which are identical with respect to their 1st component but different with respect to their 2nd component.  In a production rule of a LR(1) set of items, ( A -> B , c ) , A->B is the 1st component , and the Look-Ahead set of symbols, which is c here, is the second component.  Now we can see that in the sets given, 1st component of the corresponding production rule is identical in both sets, and they only differ in 2nd component ( i.e. their look-ahead symbols) hence we can combine these sets to make a a single set which would be : X -> c.X, c/d/$ X -> .cX, c/d/$ X -> .d, c/d/$ This is done to reduce the total number of parser states.  Now we can check the statements given.  Statement 1 : The statement is false, as merging has been done because 2nd components i.e. look-ahead were different.  Statement 2 : In the merged set, we can't see any Shift-Reduce conflict ( because no reduction even possible, reduction would be possible when a production of form P -> q. is present)  Statement 3 : In the merged set, we can't see any Reduce-Reduce conflict ( same reason as above, no reduction even possible, so no chances of R-R conflict )  Statement 4: This statement is also wrong, because goto is carried on Non-Terminals symbols, not on terminal symbols, and c is a terminal symbol.

Commutativity: A binary operation  ∗ on a set S is said to be commutative if it satisfies the condition: a ∗b=b ∗a   for all a, b,  ∈S. In this case, the order in which elements are combined does not matter. Solution: Here a binary operation on a set of integers is defined as x⊕ y = x2 + y2. for Commutativity: x ⊕y= y ⊕x. LHS=> x ⊕y=  x^2+ y^2 RHS=> y ⊕x=  y^2+x^2 LHS = RHS. hence commutative. for Associativity: x ⊕ (y ⊕ z) =(x ⊕ y) ⊕ z LHS=> x ⊕ (y⊕  z) = x ⊕ ( y^2+z^2)= x^2+(y^2+z^2)^2 RHS=> (x ⊕y) ⊕z= ( x^2+y^2) ⊕z=(x^2+y^2)^2+z^2 So, LHS ≠ RHS, hence not associative. Another Solution : ⊕ commutative as x ⊕ y is always same as y ⊕ x. ⊕ is not associative as (x ⊕ y) ⊕ z is (x^2 + y^2)^2 + z^2, but x ⊕ (y ⊕ z) is x^2 + (y^2 + z^2)^2.",

We can write the grammar which accepts this string as follows: S->aB B->bC C->cd The Right Most Derivation for the above is: S -> aB ( Reduction 3 ) -> abC ( Reduction 2 ) -> abcd ( Reduction 1 ) We can see here that no production is for unit or epsilon. Hence 3 reductions here.

So total invocations of the network layer: At S At R1 At R2 At D Total = 4 times Data Link Layer: Operates hop-by-hop (over each physical link). Each hop involves: One send (Data Link layer at sender) One receive (Data Link layer at receiver) There are 3 links : S → R1 R1 → R2 R2 → D Each link = 2 uses of Data Link Layer (send + receive) Total = 3 × 2 = 6 times Final Answer: (C) Network layer – 4 times and Data link layer – 6 times,
