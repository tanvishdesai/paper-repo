1,"The semaphore variables full, empty and mutex are initialized to 0, n and 1, respectively. Process P 1 repeatedly adds one item at a time to a buffer of size n, and process P 2 repeatedly removes one item at a time from the same buffer using the programs given below. In the programs, K, L, M and N are unspecified statements. P1 while (1) { K; P(mutex);

Add an item to the buffer;

V(mutex); L; } P2 while (1) { M; P(mutex);

Remove an item from the buffer;

Semaphore ‘full’ is initialized to '0'. This means there is no item in the buffer. Semaphore ‘empty’ is initialized to 'n'. This means there is space for n items in the buffer. In process P1, wait on semaphore 'empty' signifies that if there is no space in buffer then P1 can not produce more items. Signal on semaphore 'full' is to signify that one item has been added to the buffer. In process P2, wait on semaphore 'full' signifies that if the buffer is empty then consumer can’t not consume any item. Signal on semaphore 'empty'  increments a space in the buffer after consumption of an item. Thus, option (D) is correct.",

5,"Consider a simplified time slotted MAC protocol, where each host always has data to send and transmits with probability p = 0.2 in every slot. There is no backoff and one frame can be transmitted in one slot. If more than one host transmits in the same slot, then the transmissions are unsuccessful due to collision. What is the maximum number of hosts which this protocol can support, if each host has to be provided a minimum through put of 0.16 frames per time slot?",,1,,2,,3,,4,,B,MCQ,"Here we are talking about slotted MAC protocol where when one station transmits, no other station can transmit.Now, assume that the probability of transmitting data by a single station be p and n be the number of stations that can transmit.  Since, when one station is transmitting no other station can transmit. So there will be n-1 stations that are silent with the probability of 1-p.  Now, for one station a minimum throughput of 0.16 frames per slot of time is to be given. So, for n stations the throughput is given by 0.16*n, and every station always has some data to transmit with the probability of p = 0.2 in every time slot.  Hence, 0.16 * n = n * 0.2 * (0.8)^(n -1) 0.8 = 0.8 ^ (n-1) Comparing both the sides we get 1 = n-1 This means n = 2",

Formally, a PDA is a 6-tuple (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q0, F) with Q being set of all possible states, Σ is the set of all possible input, Γ is the set of all possible stack symbol, δ : Q × Σ × Γ → Q × Γ is the transition function, q0 is the initial state, and F ⊆ Q is the set of final state. Some times, PDA is also known to be of 7 tuples when we considers the initial stack symbol z0 as an additional member in the above 6 tuples. Note that there should exists a transition function for a given input otherwise there won’t be any possible move. The PDA can be of two types: Empty stack accepting PDA and Final state PDA. Empty stack accepting PDAs are the PDAs for which a given input is accepted if on a given input string, when the input exhausts, the stack should be empty. Similarly, a Final state accepting PDA is a PDA for which a given input is accepted if on a given input string, when the input exhausts, thePDA should be in one of the final states. A Non-deterministic PDA or NPDA is a PDA in which, for a given input, multiple output is possible. i.e. The Transition function δ maps a given input from Q × Σ × Γ to a finite set of Q × Γ. For the given question , since there is a more than one output corresponding to a given input for transition function, we will consider a NPDA for the execution of the input and we will halt our execution for a corresponding branch if there is no move possible for a given input and We assume that if the machine halts at one of the final state and input is exhausted, we accept the string otherwise we reject it. Notice, the Given PDA is final state accepting PDA and not the empty stack accepting PDA. Choice of the Questions: We will assume the initial stack symbol is ε, and • In choice 1 , The execution will be as follow: (s, a, ) → (s, a) or (f, ε). Let’s first consider, (s, a) as output and execute the remaining input. (s,a, a) → No valid Move. halt this branch and not in the final state, so not accepted. Now consider (f, ε) as output. (f, a, ε) → No Valid Move. halt this branch Notice that the PDA is in one of the final state, But the input string is not exhausted, So this should not be accepted by the PDA. • In choice 2 , The Execution will start as of choice 1 and will halt at character 2 as no possible move. This option is also not accepted in same way as of the first option. 3 • In choice 3 , The execution will be as follow: (s, b, ε) → (s, a). (s, a, a) → No Possible move. halt this branch . Since halted before reaching to any final state so this option is not accepted. • In choice 4 , This option is also not accepted as the PDA will halt at second character as it halted in previous option. This option is also not accepted. Assuming that if the PDA halts on a input due to no possible move and if the current state is one of the final state but the input is not exhausted, PDA will reject that string, For Question 2, Every answer is true i.e. None of the given for string belongs to the given PDA’s language. Again, Assuming that if the PDA halts on a input due to no possible move and if the current state is one of the final state but the input is not exhausted, the PDA will keep on consuming the input string until the end of string comes, string in option (A) and option (B) will be accepted by the language of this PDA. while option (C) and option (D) still won’t get accepted as by the end of the string, the PDA won’t be in final state. So keeping this assumption in mind, option (C) and option (D) both will be true for this question.",

As soon as result is available after ALU operation (in 1st instruction), result is transferred as input to ALU unit, then updated value of R1 gets available after ALU operation (otherwise it is available after WB stage),so no stalls are there. • The ALU result from the EX/MEM register is always fed back to the ALU input latches. If the forwarding hardware detects that the previous ALU operation has written the register corresponding to the source for the current ALU operation, control logic selects the forwarded result as the ALU input rather than the value read from the register file. • As given in Ques, It is straight from question,register R1 value is copied(or better say loaded) to memory location M[100] then M[100]'s value is stored to registers R2 and R3 .Options A,B and C are wrong since they do not produce same result as desired. • Let's suppose register R1,R2,R3 and memory reference M[100] have initial values 10,20,30 and 40 respectively then after the execution of sequence of operation,registers R2,R3 and memory references M[100] have values 10,10 and 10 respectively. • In option A ,after the execution of operations,registers R2,R3 and memory references M[100] have values 20,10 and 20 respectively.

In case of encountering an error the sender has to resend all the data frames following the error. According to the question: The data rate of the link is 20 Kbps and the propagation delay = 400 ms So, the time required to transmit 100 bytes long data will be given by Transmission Time t = Number of bits to be transmitted / data rate of the link = (100* 8 bits) /20 Kbps =  40 ms Now, the propagation delay is given as d = 400 ms So the efficiency of the link is given by: Efficiency E = N * t / ( t+ 2 * d ) Where N = window size E = 10 * 40 / (40+2*400) = 0.476 So, the maximum data rate attainable = 0.476 * 20 Kbps = 9.52 Kbps This is close to 10.

This is because we may need to traverse the entire list to find the node that precedes Q.
