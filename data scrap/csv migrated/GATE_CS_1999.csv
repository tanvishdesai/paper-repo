The DMA and Demand Paging improves the performance of the OS. Hence they are not necessary conditions in a multi-programming.

Now if we choose a decomposition positively then we can choose something like R1(S, T, U) and R2(U, V) then we can say that decomposition is lossless because common attribute is U and LHS of every FDs are candidate key, therefore it is in 2NF as well as 3NF.

[Tex]P(E1|E2) = \\frac{1/5}{1/3} = \\frac{3}{5}[/Tex]
A option is wrong, since it is given in the question.
B option is wrong since [Tex]P(E1|E2)[/Tex] is not equal to [Tex]P(E1 \\cap E2)[/Tex]
D option is wrong since [Tex]P(E1|E2) = \\frac{3}{5}[/Tex]

23,Suppose that the expectation of a random variable X is 5.

The first option is wrong since the Expected value need not be present in the data.
The second option is wrong since in the event where every value in the data is the same, the expected value is the same as every value. So, In this case, there is no value which is greater than the expected value.
The third option is correct, Since there must be some value which is either equal to or greater than the expected value. This is because it is impossible to have all the values less than the expected value as it is analogous to the mean. And the mean value is never greater than all the values of the data.",

A certain computer system has the segmented paging architecture for virtual memory. The memory is byte addressable. Both virtual and physical address spaces contain 216 bytes each. The virtual address space is divided into 8 non-overlapping equal size segments. The memory management unit (MMU) has a hardware segment table, each entry of which contains the physical address of the page table for the segments. Page tables are stored in the main memory and consists of 2 byte page table entries.

a. What is the minimum page size in bytes so that the page table for a segment requires at most one page to store it? Assume that the page size can only be a power of 2.

b. Now suppose that the pages size is 512 bytes. It is proposed to provide a TLB (Transaction look-aside buffer) for speeding up address translation. The proposed TLB will be capable of storing page table entries for 16 recently referenced virtual pages, in a fast cache that will use the direct mapping scheme. What is the number of tag bits that will need to be associated with each cache entry?

c. Assume that each page table entry contains (besides other information) 1 valid bit, 3 bits for page protection and 1 dirty bit. How many bits are available in page table entry for storing the aging information for the page? Assume that the page size is 512 bytes.",,,,,,,,,,,MCQ,,

Option (B) is True because  By searching leaf level linearly in B+ tree, we can say a node is present or not in B+ tree. But for B tree we have to traverse the whole tree and Most of the database system use indexes built on some form of a B+ tree  due to its many advantages, in particular its support for range queries. Leaf nodes are linked together in B+ tree. Hence range queries are faster.

Option (C) is False because B tree and B+ tree uses for dynamic multilevel indexes not for primary or secondary index.

Option (D) is False because Height depends on number of record as well as max no of keys in each node (i.e. order of tree) .",

Lets understand with another example as we have grammar like this  A→AA  using this grammar we can not produce any string in finite steps as language of this grammar is empty set {}.
Hence, we finally get conclusion as if  grammar is having both left as well as  right recursion, then grammar may or may not be ambiguous.
