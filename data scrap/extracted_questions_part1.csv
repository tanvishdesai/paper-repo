Suppose we have a function HALTS which when applied to any arbitrary function f and its arguments will say TRUE if function f terminates for those argumentsÂ  and FALSE otherwise. Example, Given the following function definition. FACTORIAL (N) = IF(N=0) THEN 1 ELSE N*FACTORIAL (N-1)
Then HALTS(FACTORIAL 4)= TRUE and HATS(FACTORIAL -5)=FLASE

Let us define the function FUNNY( f ) = IF HALTS( ff ) THEN not( ff ) ELSE TRUE a.Â  Show that FUNNY terminates for all functions f b.Â  Use (a) to prove (by contradiction) that it is not possible to have a function like HALTS which for arbitrary functions and inputs says whether it willÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â terminate on that input or not.",Theory of Computation,Computability,Turing machines and undecidability

Let G be a connected, undirected graph. A cut in G is a set of edges whose removal results in 0 being broken into two or more components which are not connected with each other. The size of a cut is called its cardinality. A men-cut of G is a cut in G of minimum cardinality. Consider the following graph. a.Â  Which of the following sets of edges is a cut?

(i) {(A,B), (E,F), (B,D), (A,E), (A,D)}

(ii)Â  {(B,D), (C,F), (A,B)}

b.Â  What is the cardinality of a min-cut in the graph?
