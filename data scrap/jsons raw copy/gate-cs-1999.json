And atleast 2 modes should be present in the CPU execution so that the privileged mode could control the resource allocation of the unprivileged mode users. The DMA and Demand Paging improves the performance of the OS. Hence they are not necessary conditions in a multi-programming. But since (a) and (c) is not answers mentions in the options so the next best option will be (C) containing both (a) and (c) along with (b).\r\nSo, option (C) is correct.",
