The computer system polls the keyboard every 10 ms (milli seconds) to check for a keystroke and consumes 100 μs (micro seconds) for each poll. If it is determined after polling that a key has been pressed, the system consumes an additional 200 μs to process the keystroke. Let T1 denote the fraction of a second spent in polling and processing a keystroke. In an alternative implementation, the system uses interrupts instead of polling. An interrupt is raised for every keystroke. It takes a total of 1 ms for servicing an interrupt and processing a keystroke. Let T2 denote the fraction of a second spent in servicing the interrupt and processing a keystroke. The ratio T1/T2 is _______. (Rounded off to one decimal place)",
